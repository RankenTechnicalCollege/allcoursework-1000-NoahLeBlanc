    <h2>Photography has been a small hobby of mine for a bit of my life.
      <br>
      Yet I found more enjoyment in art for the longest time.
      <br>
      One day I got a new phone and discovered it had a built in photo editor!
      <br> <br>
      after some time I got better and better at editing photos.
      and i'm pretty proud of the photos i've made so far.
      <br>
      One of my recent edited photos is seen here!

      <div id="editingChoices">
        <h3>why edit it this way?:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>I wanted it to look similar to a game I was playing at the time.</li>
          <li>The original photo was way to saturated, that's why it's so desaturated now.</li>
          <li>Because it's my art.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 style="color: brown;">This photo was taken on a road going to Kentucky <!--inline css-->
          I was in the passenger seat of my girlfriends car.
          <br>
          I thought the vehicle looked awesome so I snapped a photo,
          then I started to edit it until I was happy with its results!

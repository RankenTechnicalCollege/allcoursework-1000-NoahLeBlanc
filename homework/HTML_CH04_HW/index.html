    <h2>Photography has been a small hobby of mine for a bit of my life.
      <br>
      Yet I found more enjoyment in art for the longest time.
      <br>
      One day I got a new phone and discovered it had a built in photo editor!
      <br> <br>
      after some time I got better and better at editing photos.
      and i'm pretty proud of the photos i've made so far.
      <br>
      One of my recent edited photos is seen here!

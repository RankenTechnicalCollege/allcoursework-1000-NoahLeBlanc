          <i>The Sticks</i> <b>10/10</b>
      </dd>
      <dt>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is my FAVORITE CD by them.
          a wonderful mixture of indie rock and folk punk.
          While the whole CD is AMAZING my favorite song
          has to be <q><i>To the Wild</i></q>
          a song about escaping from society back to a
          more animalistic primal side of humanity
          stripping yourself of all of societies burdens.
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One other thing about this CD I adore, is that
          it feels very close to my personal struggles as a
          trans women, especially if you listen to the song
          <q><i>All Gone</i></q>
          which is considered a bonus track in the CD.
          I won't go into more detail here about it.
          but god do I relate to it.
          <br> You can listen to it

          <i>Touch Up</i> <b>9/10</b>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even though this is 2nd on my favorites list
        it still is just as good as <i>The Sticks</i>
        While this CD is still considered indie Rock
        it manages to have a sort of country vibe within it.
        but enough about <i>how it sounds</i> lets get into
        what it's about!
        <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Touch up</i> is all about bodies, specifically the
        trauma of being treated poorly because of how yours looks.
        A great example of this is the song <q><i>Oh Ana</i></q>
        a song about starving and self harming ones self; in 
        an attempt to achieve beauty. in a way playing god with
        ones self...
        <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;you can even witness the singers perception through the 
        repitition of the lyrics.
        repeatedly stating <q>I'll be God
          I'll be God, I'll be God, I'll be God today</q> at
          the start of every verse.
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like before I could go into
          more detail, but the song is rather graphic. 
          so if you are in the right mind space for it.
          <br>

        <i>O My Heart</i> <b>7/10</b>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My third favorite CD by MOTHER <i>MOTHER</i>.
        this CD is by far the most <strong>INDIE ROCK</strong> of all three CD
        and likewise, one of their most popular CD. Even getting a full studio remaster!
        <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While a lot of people love the song <i>Hayloft</i> I personally prefer the song
        <i>Wisdom</i>. A song about regrets, feeling like you wasted your youth on dumb stuff.
        I could go on and on about why this song is important to me; but that'd require an essay.
        all you need to know, is that I really have a soft spot for this particular song.

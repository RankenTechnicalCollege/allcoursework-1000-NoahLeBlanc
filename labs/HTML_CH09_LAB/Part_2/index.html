        Welcome, gentlemen, to Aperture Science.
        Astronauts, war heroes,
        Olympians--you're here because we want the best,
        and you are it.
        So: Who is ready to make some science

      <p id="section2">
        There's a thousand tests performed every day
        in our enrichment spheres. Top of the line science
        equipment here.

        They say great science is built on the shoulders of giants.
        Not here. At Aperture, we do all our science from scratch.
        No hand holding!

          The Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device
          (also known as the Portal Gun, ASHPoD, Aperture Science Quantum Tunneling Device,
          or ASHPD) is the experimental tool designed to place two portals that objects
          can pass through.

          The Weighted Companion Cube (often referred to as the Companion Cube)
          is designed to help our test subject complete tests, properly.

          Turrets serve as one of the main testing obstacles in our facility.
          Armed with almost nearly unlimited ammunition and deadly accuracy,
          they will attempt to kill any enemy on sight.

          The Rocket Turret, also called a Rocket Sentry.
          outfitted with a rocket launcher.
          Upon activation, it will slowly lock onto any enemy
          and emit a sound before firing a rocket.
          it cannot be disabled or destroyed by most means.
          a new paradigm of rocket launching tech!
